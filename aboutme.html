<bodyp>
My name is Jada, I am a Octopodidae octopus 🐙
🐙 The independent type, wildly intelligent and creative, but rather un-interested in what anyone else is doing.I'm often considered the most independent of all the personality types in octopus, and cooperate best when given freedom. I Squirt ink when threatened 🐙    
my ability is to defend myself against predators by explusing ink, camouflage and threat performances, another ability is to jet quickly through the water, and the ability to hide. All octopuses are venomous, but only the blue-ringed octopuses are known to be deadliest to humans.🐚\
I am also a artist, and a writer. I develop creative stories, with false realism. my favorite subject is English. English is my favorite subject because we have slient reading. I have the time to endure my book and transfer to another dimension of reality. I enjoy watching classic horror movies and reading the novels, But the books are better.
I only watch the movies to compare the movie from the book. My favorite color is mossy green. The color eminds me of a avacodos skin.l
